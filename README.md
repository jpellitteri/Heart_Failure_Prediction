# Heart_Failure_Prediction
Heart Failure Prediction Using Random Forest, ANN, and Support Vector Machine
# Objective
The objective is to create a model to accurately classify heart failure https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.
# Algorithms
Three machine learning algorithms are used; Random Forest Classifier, Artificial Neural Network (MLP Classifier), and Support Vector Machine.  GridSearchSV is used for optimal tuning for each algorthm and then the best parameters are applied to the test data for results.  
# Results
Random Forest was the best predictor with the highest accuracy and precision.  ANN was the second best and SVC was a close third, however with poor precision.
